# LTX-Video Model Card
This model card focuses on the model associated with the LTX-Video model, codebase available [here](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video).

LTX-Video is the first DiT-based video generation model capable of generating high-quality videos in real-time. It produces 24 FPS videos at a 768x512 resolution faster than they can be watched. Trained on a large-scale dataset of diverse videos, the model generates high-resolution videos with realistic and varied content.
We provide a model for both text-to-video as well as image+text-to-video usecases

The peaks are jagged and irregular, with some rising sharply into the sky while others are more rounded. The valleys are deep and narrow, with steep slopes that are also covered in snow. The trees in the foreground are mostly bare, with only a few leaves remaining on their branches. The sky is overcast, with thick clouds obscuring the sun. The overall impression is one of peace and tranquility, with the snow-covered mountains standing as a testament to the power and beauty of nature.</details> |

## Model Details
- **Developed by:** Lightricks
- **Model type:** Diffusion-based text-to-video and image-to-video generation model
- **Language(s):** English


## Usage

### Direct use
You can use the model for purposes under the [license](https://github.com/Lightricks/LTX-Video/blob/main/LICENSE)

### General tips:
* The model works on resolutions that are divisible by 32 and number of frames that are divisible by 8 + 1 (e.g. 257). In case the resolution or number of frames are not divisible by 32 or 8 + 1, the input will be padded with -1 and then cropped to the desired resolution and number of frames.
* The model works best on resolutions under 720 x 1280 and number of frames below 257.
* Prompts should be in English. The more elaborate the better. Good prompt looks like `The turquoise waves crash against the dark, jagged rocks of the shore, sending white foam spraying into the air. The scene is dominated by the stark contrast between the bright blue water and the dark, almost black rocks. The water is a clear, turquoise color, and the waves are capped with white foam. The rocks are dark and jagged, and they are covered in patches of green moss. The shore is lined with lush green vegetation, including trees and bushes. In the background, there are rolling hills covered in dense forest. The sky is cloudy, and the light is dim.`

### Online demo

### Diffusers 🧨

LTX Video is compatible with the [Diffusers Python library](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/index). It supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation.

Make sure you install `diffusers` before trying out the examples below.

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

Now, you can run the examples below:

```py
import torch
from diffusers import LTXPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video

pipe = LTXPipeline.from_pretrained("Lightricks/LTX-Video", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "A woman with long brown hair and light skin smiles at another woman with long blonde hair. The woman with brown hair wears a black jacket and has a small, barely noticeable mole on her right cheek. The camera angle is a close-up, focused on the woman with brown hair's face. The lighting is warm and natural, likely from the setting sun, casting a soft glow on the scene. The scene appears to be real-life footage"
negative_prompt = "worst quality, inconsistent motion, blurry, jittery, distorted"

video = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=704,
    height=480,
    num_frames=161,
    num_inference_steps=50,
).frames[0]
export_to_video(video, "output.mp4", fps=24)
```

For image-to-video:

```py
import torch
from diffusers import LTXImageToVideoPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video, load_image

pipe = LTXImageToVideoPipeline.from_pretrained("Lightricks/LTX-Video", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
pipe.to("cuda")

image = load_image(
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/a-r-r-o-w/tiny-meme-dataset-captioned/resolve/main/images/8.png"
)
prompt = "A young girl stands calmly in the foreground, looking directly at the camera, as a house fire rages in the background. Flames engulf the structure, with smoke billowing into the air. Firefighters in protective gear rush to the scene, a fire truck labeled '38' visible behind them. The girl's neutral expression contrasts sharply with the chaos of the fire, creating a poignant and emotionally charged scene."
negative_prompt = "worst quality, inconsistent motion, blurry, jittery, distorted"

video = pipe(
    image=image,
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=704,
    height=480,
    num_frames=161,
    num_inference_steps=50,
).frames[0]
export_to_video(video, "output.mp4", fps=24)
```

To learn more, check out the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/ltx_video). 

Diffusers also supports directly loading from the original LTX checkpoints using the `from_single_file()` method. Check out [this section](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/ltx_video#loading-single-files) to learn more.

## Limitations
- This model is not intended or able to provide factual information.
- As a statistical model this checkpoint might amplify existing societal biases.
- The model may fail to generate videos that matches the prompts perfectly.
- Prompt following is heavily influenced by the prompting-style.
